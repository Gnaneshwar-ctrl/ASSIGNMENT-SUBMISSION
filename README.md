# ASSIGNMENT-SUBMISSION

Due to the short time for submission I have choose to work on the following simple python tools which can be used in managing/working with servers: 

Project1: (registryData, winTree)
	These 2 scripts are written for windows platform. 
	As many people might have been familiar with "tree" cmd in linux based operating systems, I have written this script which can do the same in windows.
	And another script to read a specific registry value.

Project2: (revShell)
	I have written this simple python script using which penetration testers/hackers can get a reverse shell in certain conditions.

Project3: (portScanner)
	I have written this simple script which can check for IP's which are accessible in our network.
